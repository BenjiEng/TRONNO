TRONNO is a task management application based on [Trello](https://trello.com/).

Task categories are shown with boards, which contain lists, with each list containing cards.

Lists can be rearranged by order within their respective boards. Cards can be moved from one list to another as well as have their order rearranged.

TRONNO uses Backbone design patterns and front-end associations between models replicating the associations found in the Rails back-end.
